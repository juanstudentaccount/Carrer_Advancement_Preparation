          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>
            My Career Advancement Preparation project aims to assist me in transitioning into an entry-level
            IT help desk position with a clear, structured plan. The users include instructors, peers, and
            potential employers who will review my achievements and deliverables that focus on career readiness
            and help me gain skills to better navigate my professional career.
          </p>
          <h3>Closing Summary</h3>
          <p>
            I successfully met my project goals by completing all required project requirements and finishing
            all of my major deliverables. One challenge was the interview section, where I completed one of
            three planned interviews. Besides this setback, all other areas of the project were successfully
            completed and aligned with my overall goal.

          <h2>4. Performance Analysis</h2>
          <h3>4.1 Budget Performance</h3>
          <p>
            My budget stayed on track since the only expense I had was my Coursera subscription, which I paid
            40 dollars a month for while completing the Google IT Support Professional Certificate.
          </p>
          <h3>4.2 Schedule Performance</h3>
          <p>
            I met my deadlines and my timelines were realistic. There were small adjustments to some due dates
            to match realistic progress, but overall my project followed a steady pace across the semester.

          <h2>5. Stakeholder Management</h2>
          <p>
            My engagement with stakeholders and potential users was positive. Whenever I received feedback, I
            approached it with an open mindset, which helped my project improve and be successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most valuable feedback came from my professor, who has strong project management experience, and
            from my peers, who were working on similar projects. Their insights helped me refine my scope,
            deliverables, and presentation of the project.

          <h2>6. Risk and Issue Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The most significant risk to my project occurred when I had to undergo a complete project change.
            This was unexpected and required a lot of work to get back on track. I handled this situation with a
            growth mindset and continued to seek feedback, which helped the project recover and succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            At project close there are no outstanding risks; the project has closed successfully and is ready to
            be used as part of my career advancement plan.

          <h3>Successes and Best Practices</h3>
          <p>
            Weekly check-ins went very well because they kept the project active and ensured I was regularly
            reflecting on progress. Consistent feedback was essential for staying on track.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Trello was also very effective for guiding me through my milestones, and I plan to continue
            using it for future projects because it helps me visualize tasks and track progress.

          <h3>Challenges and Problems</h3>
          <p>
            Challenges during my project included keeping up with deadlines while also managing other coursework.
            Balancing project presentations, labs, and personal assignments at the same time was difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staying consistent with an organized plan, using tools like Trello, and breaking work into smaller
            pieces helped me manage this workload and stay on track.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan with a realistic scope and timeline.</strong> When beginning a project,
              planning is essential in order to set the scope and set realistic timelines for a single
              semester.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use a weekly review to adjust the plan early.</strong> Revisit status reports
              every week to check what&apos;s on track, what&apos;s at risk, and which tasks need to be moved,
              simplified, or dropped so the overall goal stays realistic.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build quality in from the start, not at the end.</strong> Use a checklist for each
              deliverable (clear writing, correct links, rubric alignment, and visual polish) and review it
              before submitting, instead of waiting until the final week to fix everything.
